This is a fork of Lua 5.3's pattern matching functions plus some added
features. This was spawned by a proposal on lua-l regarding the first feature
below (the balanced string with escape).

Current extra features:

* `%Bxyz`: new token that behaves like %bxy, but with a specified escape
  character. `x` is the starting character, `y` is the escape character, and
  `z` is the ending character. As with the two arguments to the built-in `%b`,
  all three arguments are always interpreted literally and never imbue special
  meaning; this applies even to the pattern-matching escape character `%`.
* Uses Lua 5.3's pattern-matching library, even on 5.1 and 5.2. This means, for
  example, that 5.1 users can gain support for patterns with null characters by
  using this library, instead of having to use the `%z` class.
* Currently, that's it. More may come eventually, but no guarantee.

Possible features in the future are listed below. The priority is given on a
scale of 0 to 10, 10 being most important, but it is a rough approximation only
and is in no way a guarantee of what order features will come in or if they
will ever come.

* Match functions that return their match data in a table or userdata instead
  of multiple return values (priority 10)
* UTF-8-aware matching (this would probably result in a backport of the whole
  `utf8` standard library to 5.1 and 5.2) (priority 6)
* Ability to apply quantifiers to parentheses (priority 4)
* `|` for alternation, as in ordinary regex (priority 1)
* Non-capturing parentheses (priority 8, but pointless unless and until support
  for group quantifiers or alternation is implemented)
* ?????
